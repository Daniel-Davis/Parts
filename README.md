# Parts
keeps track of electrical parts and pieces

It would keep track of small gears, resisters, switches, wires, etc. 
Several attributes could be used such as serial numbers, name of the parts, specific uses, colors, different types of broader parts like switches could have several different types of switches.
I would imagine i would pull out the variables such as names and serial numbers that i would have.
